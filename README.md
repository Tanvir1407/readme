# Main Heading: My Markdown Document

This is a paragraph of text introducing the document. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original goal was to create a format that is easy to read and write in its source code form.

## Text Formatting ✍️

Here are some common ways to style text:

-   **Bold text** is created with two asterisks or underscores.
-   *Italic text* is created with one asterisk or underscore.
-   ***Bold and italic text*** can be combined.
-   You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for text that is no longer relevant.
-   `inline code` is useful for mentioning variables or commands.

## Blockquotes and Code

> To be, or not to be, that is the question:
> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
> And by opposing end them.

Here is a block of Python code with syntax highlighting:

```python
def greet(name):
  """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
